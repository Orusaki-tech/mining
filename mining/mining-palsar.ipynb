    "# Mining PALSAR Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "- Lineament extraction and structural analysis using SRTM 30m DEM + PALSAR 2023-2024\n",
    "- Enhanced lineament detection through multi-source data fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. **Lineament Map**: Binary map showing detected linear features (faults, fractures, structural lineaments)\n",
    "2. **Lineament Density**: Number of lineaments per square kilometer - identifies zones of high structural complexity\n",
    "3. **Lineament Orientation**: Directional analysis (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW) - shows dominant structural trends\n",
    "4. **Lineament Confidence**: Probability map (0-1) indicating detection reliability based on multi-source agreement\n",
    "5. **DEM-based Lineaments**: Topographic lineaments from elevation, curvature, and aspect variance\n",
    "6. **PALSAR-based Lineaments**: Radar-detected lineaments from backscatter edges and HH/HV ratios\n",
    "7. **Combined Lineaments**: Enhanced detection combining DEM + PALSAR for higher confidence\n",

    "## Interpreting Lineament Maps for Structural Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Identify Different Structural Features\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Faults (Major Structural Discontinuities)**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Long, continuous linear features (>1 km)\n",
    "  - High confidence scores (>0.7)\n",
    "  - Often appear in parallel sets or conjugate pairs\n",
    "  - May show topographic offsets in DEM\n",
    "  - Strong radar backscatter contrast in PALSAR\n",
    "- **Look for:** Straight or slightly curved lines with consistent orientation\n",
    "- **Mineral Exploration:** Faults can act as conduits for mineralizing fluids\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Fractures/Joints (Smaller Discontinuities)**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Shorter lineaments (<1 km)\n",
    "  - Often occur in sets with similar orientations\n",
    "  - Medium confidence scores (0.4-0.7)\n",
    "  - May form networks or grids\n",
    "- **Look for:** Clustered short lineaments with similar directions\n",
    "- **Mineral Exploration:** Fracture networks can host mineralization\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Zones of Structural Complexity**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - High lineament density (>5/km²)\n",
    "  - Multiple intersecting lineament orientations\n",
    "  - High confidence areas with overlapping detections\n",
    "  - Complex patterns (not simple linear features)\n",
    "- **Look for:** Areas with dense, intersecting lineaments in density map\n",
    "- **Mineral Exploration:** These zones often indicate favorable areas for mineralization\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Shear Zones**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Broad zones with multiple parallel lineaments\n",
    "  - Consistent orientation over large areas\n",
    "  - High aspect variance\n",
    "  - May show topographic lineations\n",
    "- **Look for:** Parallel lineament sets with consistent orientation\n",
    "- **Mineral Exploration:** Shear zones are important for gold and base metal deposits\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Dykes/Intrusive Features**\n",
    "- **Characteristics:**\n",
    "  - Linear features with consistent orientation\n",
    "  - May cross-cut other structures\n",
    "  - Strong radar signature (high HH/HV ratio)\n",
    "  - Topographic ridges or valleys\n",
    "- **Look for:** Linear features that cut across regional structures\n",
    "- **Mineral Exploration:** Can indicate pathways for mineralizing fluids\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Confidence Map:**\n",
    "- **High confidence (>0.7):** Reliable detection - likely real structural feature\n",
    "- **Medium confidence (0.4-0.7):** Probable feature - verify with field work\n",
    "- **Low confidence (<0.4):** Uncertain - may be noise or subtle features\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Density Map:**\n",
    "- **High density zones (>5/km²):** Focus areas for detailed exploration\n",
    "- **Medium density (2-5/km²):** Moderate structural activity\n",
    "- **Low density (<2/km²):** Stable areas, less favorable for mineralization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the Orientation Map:**\n",
    "- **Dominant orientations:** Indicate regional stress directions\n",
    "- **Multiple orientations:** Suggest complex structural history\n",
    "- **Preferred orientations:** Can guide drilling direction\n"
